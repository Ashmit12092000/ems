when clicking login button in login page , it is again loading the login page instead of going to desired dashboard page .

Looking at your code, I can see the issue. The problem is in your navigation logic in the _layout.tsx files. You have multiple layout files with conflicting navigation logic that's causing a redirect loop.

Let me fix this by updating the main layout file to handle the navigation properly:

app/_layout.tsx
Now let me also update the auth layout to remove conflicting navigation logic:

app/(auth)/_layout.tsx
And update the app layout as well:

app/(app)/_layout.tsx
The issue was that you had multiple layout files trying to handle navigation logic, which created conflicts and redirect loops. The main fixes:

Centralized navigation logic: All navigation logic is now in the main _layout.tsx file
Removed conflicting logic: The (auth) and (app) layout files now just render their children
Better condition handling: Added proper checks for when the user is not in any specific group
This should resolve the login redirect loop and allow successful navigation to the dashboard after login.
